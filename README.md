# Google Capstone Project Using R

## Introduction

This case study is a part of the Google Data Analytics Professional certification. It focuses on Cyclist, a bikeshare company that records customer trips over a 12-month period (October 21 to September 22). The data is made available by Motivate International Inc under this license: https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement. To conduct the analysis, I will follow the six steps of data analysis learned in this certification, which are: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act (A.P.P.A.S.A).

## Scenario

I am a data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. The company's objective is to maximize the number of annual members. To achieve this goal, we need to gain a comprehensive understanding of how casual riders and annual members utilize the bike-sharing service differently. By analyzing their usage patterns and behaviors, we can identify potential strategies to encourage more customers to become annual members and thereby boost overall membership.
